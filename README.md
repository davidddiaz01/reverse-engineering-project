# reverse-engineering-project
This repository contains all files required to recreate a standard glasses fram. these glasses was created as a reverse engineering project during my time at Chaffey College. For this project, a standard glasses to determine its components and construction. Then, using a digital calipher, the parts were recreated via Solidworks into models and drawings that are dimensionally accurate.

The files are organized into three folders; one folder contains the 3D Solidworks file, the second contains drawings in standard Solidworks drawing format, while the last folder contains the drawings as PDFs for your convenience. These files can be accessed via their respective folders.

If there are any comments, and/or questions regarding these files, please feel free to contact me via my website: https://davidddiaz01.wixsite.com/mysite/blank-page
